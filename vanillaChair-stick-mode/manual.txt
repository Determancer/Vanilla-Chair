站在台阶或楼梯上时手持胡萝卜钓竿右击方块即可将该方块“转化”为椅子，空手右击即可坐上。
坐着的时候手持胡萝卜钓竿右击即可清除所坐的椅子。

附加提醒：
- 当（楼梯“转化”成的）椅子面东或面南时，若椅子前紧邻不透明方块，从椅子上下来可能会导致窒息伤害。在椅子两侧添加活板门可避免发生此类情况。
- 椅子保质期为 3.4 年（若使它永恒，则数量一多负担会加重）。


Stand on a slab or a stair, use Carrot on a Stick on it to "transform" the block into a chair. 
Right-click with bare hands to sit on it.
When sitting in a chair, use Carrot on a Stick to remove it.

Notifications:
- When the chair (transformed from a stair) is facing south or east, and there is a opaque block right in front of it, then getting off the chair may cause suffocoating damage. Attach trapdoors beside the chair block can prevent this.
- The expiration date on each chair is 3.4 years (making it eternal will add to PC's burden, especially when there are many a chair).
